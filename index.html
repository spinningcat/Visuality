   This page is prepared for demonstrating my works in one place. I reckon to make my code and its result accessible in one page is beneficial for who wants  to take a look at my work and who is/are probably a spesific person that is assigned to evaluate such developments before hiring someone. Thats cool idea huh. It is not finished yet but i am on my way. The info button at the right and top of each box is for giving you short information what this development stands for. The thing inside the box is clickable so when you click "JavaScript Source" For example, you will have a chance to check the code. Anyway thats the idea you know demonstrating my work in one place and make it easy to access.
